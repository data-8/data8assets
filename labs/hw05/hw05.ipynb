    "# 1. Climate and water\n",
    "To get more practice analyzing data with tables, you'll work with a dataset about climate.  Theory says that land masses near large bodies of water have more moderate temperatures, since the water cools the land when it's hot and warms it when it's cold.  You'll be investigating whether that means places near coastlines have smaller daily temperature fluctuations than places far away from coastlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates thousands of weather stations (mostly in the US) that collect information about local climate.  Among other things, each station records the highest and lowest observed temperature each day.  These data, called \"Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data,\" are publicly available [here](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/) and described [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/quality-controlled-local-climatological-data-qclcd).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 3 tables:\n",
    "* The main dataset is a sample of all the daily readings from 2015.  (There were half a million total readings in the original dataset, but that takes some time to process, so we've sampled it for you.)  These are in a table called `daily_temp.csv`.  Each row corresponds to one day at one station, and includes the maximum and minimum temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) for that day, the day (in MonthDay format), and an identifier, called a WBAN (Weather Bureau Army Navy) ID, for the station that made the reading.  When you read this into a Table, call it `daily_temp`.\n",
    "* A separate table, called `stations.csv`, contains information about each station.  In particular, it gives the global coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each station, identified by WBAN ID.  Call this Table `stations`.  **Note:** `stations.csv` actually uses the pipe character (\"`|`\") to separate values, rather than commas.  To read it, use `Table.read_table(\"stations.csv\", sep=\"|\")` .\n",
    "* A third table, called `coast_distance.csv`, tells us roughly how far away every place on Earth (to a precision of half a degree latitude/longitude) is from a coastline.  The data come from [a NASA project](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/DistFromCoast/).  Call this table `coast_distance`.\n",

    "Recall the setup: The British Royal Air Force (RAF) want to know how many warplanes the Germans have.  They hypothesize that the Germans label their planes with serial numbers, starting from 1 for the first plane, and increasing by 1 for each new plane built.  That means that the number of planes the Germans have is equal to the largest serial number among their planes.  Let's call that number `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAF make the further assumption that each time the Germans send a plane into combat, they send one of their planes chosen uniformly at random, and an RAF observer always reports its serial number.  (That's not really true, and it's not exactly what the RAF assumed, but it makes the math simpler for this example.)  Some planes might be observed several times, or not at all.  So if the Germans have 5 planes and send planes into combat 3 times, the RAF might observe the serial numbers 4, 1, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a bunch of these random observations of serial numbers, the RAF want to estimate `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to simulate that sampling process and try out a few methods for estimating `N`.  Then we'll check how well each method typically does at estimating `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3.1.** Suppose that `N` is actually 120 (though the RAF don't know that) and we observe serial numbers 14 times.\n",
    "1. Write a function called `simulate_observations` to simulate that by making an array of 14 random serial numbers.  Your function should take no arguments and return the random array it generates.  Follow the random observation process described above.\n",
    "2. **Then**, set `observations` to the result of one call to `simulate_observations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Remember the function `np.random.randint`.  The documentation is [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.random.randint.html); again, the examples at the end of the documentation are probably more useful than the other text.
