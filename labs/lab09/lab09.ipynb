    "# 1. Predicting House Prices\n",
    "For many people, their house is their most valuable asset, so selling a house is an important event.  When deciding on a price to sell at, an owner wants to ask for the highest price at which she can sell the house in a reasonable amount of time.  Owners often ask real-estate agents to set the price, and these agents use their knowledge of the house and the local housing market to guess at the right price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can do that with a computer instead, by mimicking prices other owners set for *similar* houses.  Since we're predicting a price, which is a number, this is a *regression* task.  And we want to use multiple pieces of information about a house to predict its price, so it's a *multiple* regression task.  Since we've learned about linear regression in this class, we'll do multiple *linear* regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table `house_prices.csv` contains the listed prices of 566 houses sold in Southern California in 2009.    For each house, it also records several of the house's attributes:\n",
    "* how big it is (in square feet),\n",
    "* the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has, and\n",
    "* the house's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The locations are represented in a peculiar way that helps us use them in linear regression: There is a column for each potential location, and each house has a 1 in the column for its location and a 0 for the other location columns.  That's a common trick; some people call these kinds of columns \"dummy variables\".\n",

    "The idea is to use the attributes of each house to predict its price.  We'll take our training data, which has both attributes and actual prices, and find a model that produces good predictions for that data.  Then, if we wanted to list a house ourselves, we could predict our own house's price and use our prediction as our price instead of consulting an expert.  Of course, that wouldn't be a good idea if the model weren't very accurate, so we'll need to measure that, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run any regressions, we need to think about how we'll evaluate the models we produce.  That means checking how accurate its predictions are -- something like the mean squared error or R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen in lecture, you don't get an accurate estimate of a model's predictive performance if you test it on the data you use to train it.  It's easy for a model to predict well on its training data -- remember linear regression with 2 data points, or 1-nearest-neighbor classification -- even if it doesn't make any sense.  The real test is how the model performs on other data from the population for which we're interested in making predictions.\n",
