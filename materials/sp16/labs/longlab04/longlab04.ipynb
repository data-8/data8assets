    "##### Background\n",
    "Swain v. Alabama was a US Supreme Court case decided in 1965.  A black man, Swain, was accused of raping a white woman, and had been convicted by an all-white jury.  The jury was selected from a panel that contained only 8 black people and 92 whites.  The panel was supposed to be a random sample from the eligible population of Talladega County, which was 26% black and 74% other ethnicities (and, by law, all male).\n",
    "\n",
    "Swain's lawyers argued that this reflected a bias in the jury panel selection process.  A five-justice majority of the Supreme Court disagreed, asserting that,\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The overall percentage disparity has been small and reflects no studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negros.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Is 8 is enough smaller than 26 to indicate bias?  This may seem like a judgement call.  Apparently five Supreme Court justices thought it was a matter of judgement.\n",

    "In fact, we can contradict the assertion with a computer simulation.  (However, the scarcity of computers at the time was no excuse.  Any statistician could have done this calculation by hand in 1965.)\n",
