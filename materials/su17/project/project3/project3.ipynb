    "# Project 3 - Classification\n",
    "Welcome to the third project of Data 8!  You will build a classifier that guesses whether a song is hip-hop or country, using only the numbers of times words appear in the song's lyrics.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier.\n",
    "2. Test a classifier on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",

    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday, 8/8. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also **complete Part 1 of the project (out of 4) and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 8/4**. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. It's best to work with someone in your lab. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/su17/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",
