    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",

This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
