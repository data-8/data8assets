    "# Lab 1: Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Data Science 8: Foundations of Data Science!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "Labs are required. There are two ways to receive credit for each lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (The normal way) Come to your lab section and work on the lab as directed. Before you leave, you need to submit the lab **and** have a staff member check you off to confirm that you came to lab section and attempted to make progress while you were there. You do not need to finish the lab or answer every question correctly to receive full credit. However, you do need to try; that's why we check you off. Expect to discuss your progress briefly with a staff member before they will check you off.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. (The hard way) Lab assignments will be posted Monday night. If you complete the entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it by 11:59pm on Tuesday, then you don't need to physically attend lab for the rest of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",

And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon. And so we thought we'd try it here for you.
