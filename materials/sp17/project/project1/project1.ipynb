    "In this project, you'll explore data from [Gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org), a website dedicated to providing a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gapminder website collects data from many sources and compiles them into tables that describe many countries around the world. All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). Their goal is \"to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset.\" All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Thursday 2/23. You can earn an early submission bonus point by submitting your completed project by Wednesday 2/22. Late submissions will be accepted until Tuesday 2/28, but a 10% late penalty will be applied for each day late. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also complete the first 8 questions and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 2/17. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. It's best to work with someone in your lab. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp17/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",
