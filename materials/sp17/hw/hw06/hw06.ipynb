It further states that the standard deviation of this normal distribution is given by $$\\frac{\\texttt{sd of the original distribution}}{\\sqrt{\\texttt{sample size}}}$$ In other words, suppose we start with *any distribution* that has standard deviation $x$, take a sample of size $n$ (where $n$ is a large number) from that distribution with replacement, and compute the mean of that sample. If we repeat this procedure many times, then those sample means will have a normal distribution with standard deviation $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n",
